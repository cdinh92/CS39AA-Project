In this exploration, the aim is to delve into the world of music industry and investigate whether a predictive model can be designed to forecast the success of songs based on the popularity scores. The focus of this analysis lies on 8 key song features: danceability, energy, mode, loudness, speechiness, instrumentalness, tempo, and valence.\n","\n","**Check the Project Part 1 [here](https://github.com/cdinh92/CS39AA-Project/blob/main/project_part1.ipynb)**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 1. Introduction\n","\n","After exploring the Spotify top songs dataset by Joakim Arvidsson on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs), I reduce it to nearly 15000 songs in the clean file named [filtered_spotify_songs.csv](https://github.com/cdinh92/CS39AA-Project/blob/main/filtered_spotify_songs.csv). Now, as we step into the training phase, three formidable models — **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, and **Linear Regression** — take center stage for a comparative analysis\n","\n","**Initial Prediction:**\n","Early predictions lean towards **Random Forest** outperforming, especially on large datasets typical of regression problems. However, this model pose a major challenge that it can’t extrapolate outside unseen data. We’ll dive deeper into these challenge later.\n","\n","**Alternative Approach:**\n","_While recognizing the potential limitations of predictive models in capturing the entirety of a song's success factors, this project might also seeks to identify common features among trending songs, just in case the predictive results are far from expectations._"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 2.
